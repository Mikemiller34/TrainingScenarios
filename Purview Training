**Title: Purview Training**

**Client Overview**

Contoso Global, a healthcare organization with 65,000 employees and 55,000 endpoints, is currently in the process of implementing the Microsoft 365 E5 suite of Security and Compliance tools. Contoso Global recently transitioned their identities, endpoints, and most of their data to the Microsoft cloud and are now looking to leverage the security benefits available to them. The legal team currently feels the greatest risk lies within their sensitive data as they currently handle many different types of personal and health information for their clients. They are seeking a Microsoft partner to help them implement Microsoft Purview Information Protection to begin discovering and classifying the sensitive data within their organization.

**Client Needs**

Leverage Microsoft Intune to onboard endpoints to Microsoft Defender for Endpoint
Enable onboarding in Microsoft Purview
Enable sensitivity labels for Groups and Sites
Data Classification:
    Start with OOTB SITs
    To start, users should be manually applying labels, with a recommendation for Highly Confidential. Confidential should be used for any file containing a Credit Card number. Any file that has a Social Security number should be Highly Confidential. We would like for a user to receive a recommendation if a SSN is detected.
    3 Sensitivity labels
        General - No Protections/Restrictions, default label, Green color
        Confidential - Orange label color
            Internal
                All internal employees need reviewer
                Adele Vance, Alex Wilber, and Megan Bowen need Co-Author
            External
                All internal employees need reviewer
                Adele Vance, Alex Wilber, and Megan Bowen need Co-Author
                Any authenticated user needs viewer access
        Highly Confidential - Red label Color, all files should have a "Highly Confidential" Watermark
            Internal
                Specific Users, Adele Vance and Alex Wilber need Co-Author, Megan Bowen needs Viewer. Make sure an Admin account has access.
            External
                Same Specific Users as "Internal", Specific Domains (Collaborate with a co-worker and add their lab tenant domain) - Viewer access

Data Loss Prevention:
    Endpoint DLP
        If a file has the Highly Confidential Label, it should not be printed, moved to a USB, added to a network share, and the contents should not be copied to a clipboard.
